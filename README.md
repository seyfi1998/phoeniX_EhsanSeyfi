# Quick Sort Algorithm in RISC-V Assembly

## Description
The Quick Sort algorithm is a widely used sorting technique that efficiently rearranges an array or list of elements into ascending or descending order. It follows a "divide and conquer" approach, recursively partitioning the array into smaller subarrays and then combining them to achieve the final sorted result.

## Algorithm Explanation
1. **Initialization**:
   - The provided code initializes an array with three elements: **10**, **13**, and **15**.
   - These elements are stored in memory locations (addresses **12**, **8**, and **4**).

2. **Sorting Process**:
   - The Quick Sort algorithm begins by selecting a **pivot element** (in this case, the first element in the array).
   - It then partitions the array into two subarrays:
     - Elements less than or equal to the pivot (to the left).
     - Elements greater than the pivot (to the right).
   - Recursively apply Quick Sort to both subarrays.
   - The sorted subarrays are then combined to form the final sorted array.

3. **Code Details**:
   - The provided code uses registers `a0`, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4`, `a5`, `t0`, `t1`, and `t2`.
   - Labels such as `swap`, `change`, and `var` handle different steps of the sorting process.
   - The `lw` (load word) and `sw` (store word) instructions read from and write to memory, respectively.
   - The `beq` (branch if equal) instruction controls program flow based on conditions.
   - The `ebreak` instruction indicates the end of the program.

4. **Results**:
   - After executing this code, the sorted array (10, 13, 15) will be stored back in memory.
   - You can verify the correctness of the sorting process by examining the memory locations.



Integer Square Root Calculation in RISC-V Assembly
Description
This RISC-V assembly code snippet calculates the integer square root of a given number. The integer square root of a number is the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the number.

Algorithm Explanation
The algorithm works by incrementally testing integers starting from 0 until it finds the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the input number.

Initialization:
a0 is initialized with the input number, in this case, 64.
t0 is used as the counter and is initialized to 0.
Loop:
The loop begins and t0 is squared and stored in t1.
If t1 (the square of t0) is greater than or equal to a0, the loop ends.
If not, t0 is incremented by 1 and the loop continues.
End:
Once the condition is met, t0 is decremented by 1 to get the integer square root.
The ebreak instruction is used to terminate the program.
Code Snippet
Assembly

# Calculate Integer Square Root
```
li a0, 64  # Initialize input number

li t0, 0   # Initialize counter

loop:
    mul t1, t0, t0  # Square the counter
    bge t1, a0, end # Check if the square is greater than the input

    addi t0, t0, 1  # Increment counter
    j loop          # Continue loop

end:
    addi t0, t0, -1 # Decrement counter to get the integer square root

    ebreak          # End of program
```

How to Run
To run this code:

Install the Venus RISC-V simulator.
Load the assembly code into the simulator.
Execute the code to calculate the integer square root of the input number.
Conclusion
This simple yet effective algorithm demonstrates the power of assembly language for performing low-level arithmetic operations efficiently. The code can be adapted for different input numbers by changing the value of a0.
